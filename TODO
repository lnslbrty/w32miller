[TODO]

1. finish cncproxy/cncmaster in a way that they send commands to an infected machine and receive the output
  * cncmaster sends commands to cncproxy, which forwards it to the target(s)
  * target(s) send command output to cncproxy, which forwards it to the cncmaster

2. more machine information gathering (keylogger/screenshots)
3. Set/Check and use Loader Flags (see loader.h)
4. recrypt strings on every new infected binary
5. hdrcrypt: use 8 byte key and pad strings less than 8 byte (random bytes after NUL)
6. spreading (local/usb/net)
7. use named shared memory segment for ipc on local machine

8. replace __xultoa with mini_itoa !?
9. packing/unpacking

last but not least:
    - make use of _API_VERSION macro
